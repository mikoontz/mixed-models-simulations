# mixed-models-simulations
simulating data suitable for fitting mixed models and trying to recover known parameter estimates. how robust are mixed models to various scenarios?

1. Does the number of levels in the categorical variable being treated as a random effect matter?
2. What if the distribution of offsets of the random variable isn't normal?
3. What if there is exact overlap between a fixed continuous variable and a categorical random effect?
